# OctaGroove
An ongoing project building an 8-track sequencer with an emphasis on algorithmic variation/generation of musical patterns. The program introduces the concept of "themes" which dynamically vary your musical patterns on the fly. Users can select a range of controls for adjusting probability and randomness, enabling fine-tuning of the level of unpredictability in the musical patterns. 

To run the program, download the latest version of SuperCollider and run `app.scd` in the scide IDE.

To create new sample kits, add a folder into `kits` with 8 subfolders named 0-7. Fill these subfolders with either `.wav` or `.aiff` files.

## Features

- Options to edit chosen steps in a sequence
- Effects
- Randomness and probability-based controls
